Silicon Zeroes solutions
========================

Personal save files for the fantasy-anachronism SPECTRE/MELTDOWN CPU design bugs reinvention game [Silicon Zeroes](http://pleasingfungus.com/Silicon%20Zeroes/).

Spoiler warning since the file names imply the theme the challenges.
But you might have already been exposed since GitHub puts the README preview after the file list. ^_^;

Currently saving the native-format solution files that are produced by the game.
I'll revisit the readability of this repo later, after making additional progress.

If these save games are useful or interesting,
take comfort that I don't care to enforce some arbitrary copyright on some fun game-related code;
just don't inexplicably harm yourself with it. (Though that would be impressive, given the imaginary architecture!)

Feel free to reach out to me if there's any concern.
Most likely response is I don't mind; what nefarious business could you possibly perpetrate with fantasy VDHL circuit descriptions?

The thought of formatting this repo to be readable is way too daunting for me right now.
Feel free to send requests for screenshots, etc, through the usual messaging channels.

Enjoy!
